<h3><a name="tag_01_10">   A.10 </a>Directory Structure and Devices</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_01_10_01">  A.10.1 </a>Directory Structure and Files</h4>

<p>A description of the historical <b>/usr/tmp</b> was omitted, removing any concept of differences in emphasis between the
<b>/</b> and <b>/usr</b> directories. The descriptions of <b>/bin</b>, <b>/usr/bin</b>, <b>/lib</b>, and <b>/usr/lib</b> were
omitted because they are not useful for applications. In an early draft, a distinction was made between system and application
directory usage, but this was not found to be useful.</p>

<p>The directories <b>/</b> and <b>/dev</b> are included because the notion of a hierarchical directory structure is key to other
information presented elsewhere in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. In early drafts, it was argued that special devices and
temporary files could conceivably be handled without a directory structure on some implementations. For example, the system could
treat the characters <tt>"/tmp"</tt> as a special token that would store files using some non-POSIX file system structure. This
notion was rejected by the standard developers, who required that all the files in this section be implemented via POSIX file
systems.</p>

<p>The <b>/tmp</b> directory is retained in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to accommodate historical applications that assume its
availability. Implementations are encouraged to provide suitable directory names in the environment variable <i>TMPDIR</i> and
applications are encouraged to use the contents of <i>TMPDIR</i> for creating temporary files.</p>

<p>The standard files <b>/dev/null</b> and <b>/dev/tty</b> are required to be both readable and writable to allow applications to
have the intended historical access to these files.</p>

<p>The standard file <b>/dev/console</b> has been added for alignment with the Single UNIX Specification.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_10_02">  A.10.2 </a>Output Devices and Terminal Types</h4>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001/Cor&nbsp;2-2004, item XBD/TC2/D6/17 is applied, making it clear that the requirements for
documenting terminal support are in the system documentation.</p>
