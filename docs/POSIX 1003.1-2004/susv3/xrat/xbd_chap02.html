<h3><a name="tag_01_02">   A.2 </a>Conformance</h3>

<p>The terms &quot;profile&quot; and &quot;profiling&quot; are used throughout this section.</p>

<p>A profile of a standard or standards is a codified set of option selections, such that by being conformant to a profile,
particular classes of users are specifically supported.</p>

<p>These conformance definitions are descended from those in the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-1:1996 standard, but with changes for the
following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The addition of profiling options, allowing larger profiles of options such as the XSI extension used by the Single UNIX
Specification. In effect, it has profiled itself (that is, created a self-profile).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The addition of a definition of subprofiling considerations, to allow smaller profiles of options.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The addition of a hierarchy of super-options for XSI; these were formerly known as &quot;Feature Groups&quot; in the System Interfaces
and Headers, Issue 5 specification.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Options from the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard are also now included, as IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 merges the
functionality from it.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_01_02_01">  A.2.1 </a>Implementation Conformance</h4>

<p>These definitions allow application developers to know what to depend on in an implementation.</p>

<p>There is no definition of a &quot;strictly conforming implementation''; that would be an implementation that provides <i>only</i>
those facilities specified by POSIX.1 with no extensions whatsoever. This is because no actual operating system implementation can
exist without system administration and initialization facilities that are beyond the scope of POSIX.1.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_01_01"></a>Requirements</h5>

<p>The word &quot;support&quot; is used in certain instances, rather than &quot;provide&quot;, in order to allow an implementation that has no
resident software development facilities, but that supports the execution of a <i>Strictly Conforming POSIX.1 Application</i>, to
be a <i>conforming implementation</i>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_01_02"></a>Documentation</h5>

<p>The conformance documentation is required to use the same numbering scheme as POSIX.1 for purposes of cross-referencing. All
options that an implementation chooses are reflected in <a href="../basedefs/limits.h.html"><i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i></a> and <a
href="../basedefs/unistd.h.html"><i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i></a>.</p>

<p>Note that the use of &quot;may&quot; in terms of where conformance documents record where implementations may vary, implies that it is
not required to describe those features identified as undefined or unspecified.</p>

<p>Other aspects of systems must be evaluated by purchasers for suitability. Many systems incorporate buffering facilities,
maintaining updated data in volatile storage and transferring such updates to non-volatile storage asynchronously. Various
exception conditions, such as a power failure or a system crash, can cause this data to be lost. The data may be associated with a
file that is still open, with one that has been closed, with a directory, or with any other internal system data structures
associated with permanent storage. This data can be lost, in whole or part, so that only careful inspection of file contents could
determine that an update did not occur.</p>

<p>Also, interrelated file activities, where multiple files and/or directories are updated, or where space is allocated or released
in the file system structures, can leave inconsistencies in the relationship between data in the various files and directories, or
in the file system itself. Such inconsistencies can break applications that expect updates to occur in a specific sequence, so that
updates in one place correspond with related updates in another place.</p>

<p>For example, if a user creates a file, places information in the file, and then records this action in another file, a system or
power failure at this point followed by restart may result in a state in which the record of the action is permanently recorded,
but the file created (or some of its information) has been lost. The consequences of this to the user may be undesirable. For a
user on such a system, the only safe action may be to require the system administrator to have a policy that requires, after any
system or power failure, that the entire file system must be restored from the most recent backup copy (causing all intervening
work to be lost).</p>

<p>The characteristics of each implementation will vary in this respect and may or may not meet the requirements of a given
application or user. Enforcement of such requirements is beyond the scope of POSIX.1. It is up to the purchaser to determine what
facilities are provided in an implementation that affect the exposure to possible data or sequence loss, and also what underlying
implementation techniques and/or facilities are provided that reduce or limit such loss or its consequences.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_01_03"></a>POSIX Conformance</h5>

<p>This really means conformance to the base standard; however, since this revision includes the core material of the Single UNIX
Specification, the standard developers decided that it was appropriate to segment the conformance requirements into two, the former
for the base standard, and the latter for the Single UNIX Specification.</p>

<p>Within POSIX.1 there are some symbolic constants that, if defined, indicate that a certain option is enabled. Other symbolic
constants exist in POSIX.1 for other reasons.</p>

<p>As part of the revision some alignment has occurred of the options with the FIPS 151-2 profile on the POSIX.1-1990 standard. The
following options from the POSIX.1-1990 standard are now mandatory:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>_POSIX_JOB_CONTROL</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>_POSIX_SAVED_IDS</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>_POSIX_VDISABLE</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A POSIX-conformant system may support the XSI extensions of the Single UNIX Specification. This was intentional since the
standard developers intend them to be upwards-compatible, so that a system conforming to the Single UNIX Specification can also
conform to the base standard at the same time.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_01_04"></a>XSI Conformance</h5>

<p>This section is added since the revision merges in the base volumes of the Single UNIX Specification.</p>

<p>XSI conformance can be thought of as a profile, selecting certain options from IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_01_05"></a>Option Groups</h5>

<p>The concept of &quot;Option Groups&quot; is introduced to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to allow collections of related functions or
options to be grouped together. This has been used as follows: the &quot;XSI Option Groups&quot; have been created to allow super-options,
collections of underlying options and related functions, to be collectively supported by XSI-conforming systems. These reflect the
&quot;Feature Groups&quot; from the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 5 specification.</p>

<p>The standard developers considered the matter of subprofiling and decided it was better to include an enabling mechanism rather
than detailed normative requirements. A set of subprofiling options was developed and included later in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 as an informative illustration.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_01_06"></a>Subprofiling Considerations</h5>

<p>The goal of not simultaneously fixing maximums and minimums was to allow implementations of the base standard or standards to
support multiple profiles without conflict.</p>

<p>The following summarizes the rules for the limit types:</p>

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" align="center">
<tr valign="top">
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Limit</b></p>
</th>
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Fixed</b></p>
</th>
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Minimum Acceptable</b></p>
</th>
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Maximum Acceptable</b></p>
</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Type</b></p>
</th>
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Value</b></p>
</th>
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Value</b></p>
</th>
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Value</b></p>
</th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">
<p class="tent">Standard</p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent"><i>Xs</i></p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent"><i>Ys</i></p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent"><i>Zs</i></p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">
<p class="tent">Profile</p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent"><i>Xp</i> == <i>Xs</i></p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent"><i>Yp</i> &gt;= <i>Ys</i></p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent"><i>Zp</i> &lt;= <i>Zs</i></p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td align="left">
<p class="tent">&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent">(No change)</p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent">(May increase the limit)</p>
</td>
<td align="center">
<p class="tent">(May decrease the limit)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The intent is that ranges specified by limits in profiles be entirely contained within the corresponding ranges of the base
standard or standards being profiled, and that the unlimited end of a range in a base standard must remain unlimited in any profile
of that standard.</p>

<p>Thus, the fixed _POSIX_* limits are constants and must not be changed by a profile. The variable counterparts (typically without
the leading _POSIX_) can be changed but still remain semantically the same; that is, they still allow implementation values to vary
as long as they meet the requirements for that value (be it a minimum or maximum).</p>

<p>Where a profile does not provide a feature upon which a limit is based, the limit is not relevant. Applications written to that
profile should be written to operate independently of the value of the limit.</p>

<p>An example which has previously allowed implementations to support both the base standard and two other profiles in a compatible
manner follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>Base standard (POSIX.1-1996): _POSIX_CHILD_MAX 6
Base standard: CHILD_MAX   minimum maximum _POSIX_CHILD_MAX
    FIPS profile/SUSv2  CHILD_MAX   25 (minimum maximum)
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>Base standard (POSIX.1-1996): _POSIX_NGROUPS_MAX 0
Base standard: NGROUPS_MAX   minimum maximum _POSIX_NGROUP_MAX
    FIPS profile/SUSv2  NGROUPS_MAX   8
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A profile may lower a minimum maximum below the equivalent _POSIX value:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>Base standard: _POSIX_foo_MAX   Z
Base standard: foo_MAX   _POSIX_foo_MAX
    profile standard : foo_MAX   X  (X can be less than, equal to,
                                    or greater than  _POSIX_foo_MAX)
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case an implementation conforming to the profile may not conform to the base standard, but an implementation to the base
standard will conform to the profile.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001/Cor&nbsp;2-2004, item XBD/TC2/D6/2 is applied, clarifying the wording under the Realtime Option
Group when _POSIX_PRIORITIZED_IO is supported to take threads into account.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_01_07"></a>Options</h5>

<p>The final subsections within <i>Implementation Conformance</i> list the core options within IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. This
includes both options for the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 and the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_02_02">  A.2.2 </a>Application Conformance</h4>

<p>These definitions guide users or adaptors of applications in determining on which implementations an application will run and
how much adaptation would be required to make it run on others. These definitions are modeled after related ones in the ISO&nbsp;C
standard.</p>

<p>POSIX.1 occasionally uses the expressions &quot;portable application&quot; or &quot;conforming application&quot;. As they are used, these are
synonyms for any of these terms. The differences between the classes of application conformance relate to the requirements for
other standards, the options supported (such as the XSI extension) or, in the case of the Conforming POSIX.1 Application Using
Extensions, to implementation extensions. When one of the less explicit expressions is used, it should be apparent from the context
of the discussion which of the more explicit names is appropriate</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_02_01"></a>Strictly Conforming POSIX Application</h5>

<p>This definition is analogous to that of an ISO&nbsp;C standard &quot;conforming program&quot;.</p>

<p>The major difference between a Strictly Conforming POSIX Application and an ISO&nbsp;C standard strictly conforming program is
that the latter is not allowed to use features of POSIX that are not in the ISO&nbsp;C standard.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_02_02"></a>Conforming POSIX Application</h5>

<p>Examples of &lt;National Bodies&gt; include ANSI, BSI, and AFNOR.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_02_03"></a>Conforming POSIX Application Using Extensions</h5>

<p>Due to possible requirements for configuration or implementation characteristics in excess of the specifications in <a href=
"../basedefs/limits.h.html"><i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i></a> or related to the hardware (such as array size or file space), not every
Conforming POSIX Application Using Extensions will run on every conforming implementation.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_02_04"></a>Strictly Conforming XSI Application</h5>

<p>This is intended to be upwards-compatible with the definition of a Strictly Conforming POSIX Application, with the addition of
the facilities and functionality included in the XSI extension.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_02_02_05"></a>Conforming XSI Application Using Extensions</h5>

<p>Such applications may use extensions beyond the facilities defined by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 including the XSI
extension, but need to document the additional requirements.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_02_03">  A.2.3 </a>Language-Dependent Services for the C Programming Language</h4>

<p>POSIX.1 is, for historical reasons, both a specification of an operating system interface, shell and utilities, and a C binding
for that specification. Efforts had been previously undertaken to generate a language-independent specification; however, that had
failed, and the fact that the ISO&nbsp;C standard is the <i>de facto</i> primary language on POSIX and the UNIX system makes this a
necessary and workable situation.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_02_04">  A.2.4 </a>Other Language-Related Specifications</h4>

<p>There is no additional rationale provided for this section.</p>
