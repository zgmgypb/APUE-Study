<h4><a name="tag_04_27_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The first synopsis form is denoted by two operands, neither of which are existing files of type directory. The <i>cp</i> utility
shall copy the contents of <i>source_file</i> (or, if <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link, the contents of the file
referenced by <i>source_file</i>) to the destination path named by <i>target_file.</i></p>

<p>The second synopsis form is denoted by two or more operands where the <b>-R</b> or <b>-r</b> options are not specified and the
first synopsis form is not applicable. It shall be an error if any <i>source_file</i> is a file of type directory, if <i>target</i>
does not exist, or if <i>target</i> is a file of a type defined by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001,
but is not a file of type directory. The <i>cp</i> utility shall copy the contents of each <i>source_file</i> (or, if
<i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link, the contents of the file referenced by <i>source_file</i>) to the destination
path named by the concatenation of <i>target</i>, a slash character, and the last component of <i>source_file</i>.</p>

<p>The third and fourth synopsis forms are denoted by two or more operands where the <b>-R</b> or <b>-r</b> options are specified.
The <i>cp</i> utility shall copy each file in the file hierarchy rooted in each <i>source_file</i> to a destination path named as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If <i>target</i> exists and is a file of type directory, the name of the corresponding destination path for each file in the
file hierarchy shall be the concatenation of <i>target</i>, a slash character, and the pathname of the file relative to the
directory containing <i>source_file</i>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>target</i> does not exist and two operands are specified, the name of the corresponding destination path for
<i>source_file</i> shall be <i>target</i>; the name of the corresponding destination path for all other files in the file hierarchy
shall be the concatenation of <i>target</i>, a slash character, and the pathname of the file relative to <i>source_file</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It shall be an error if <i>target</i> does not exist and more than two operands are specified, or if <i>target</i> exists and is
a file of a type defined by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, but is not a file of type
directory.</p>

<p>In the following description, the term <i>dest_file</i> refers to the file named by the destination path. The term
<i>source_file</i> refers to the file that is being copied, whether specified as an operand or a file in a file hierarchy rooted in
a <i>source_file</i> operand. If <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If neither the <b>-R</b> nor <b>-r</b> options were specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions based on the type and contents of
the file referenced by the symbolic link, and not by the symbolic link itself.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the <b>-R</b> option was specified:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If none of the options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, nor <b>-P</b> were specified, it is unspecified which of <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, or
<b>-P</b> will be used as a default.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the <b>-H</b> option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions based on the type and contents of the file referenced by any
symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the <b>-L</b> option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions based on the type and contents of the file referenced by any
symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand or any symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the <b>-P</b> option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall copy any symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand and any
symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file hierarchy, and shall not follow any symbolic links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the <b>-r</b> option was specified, the behavior is implementation-defined.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For each <i>source_file</i>, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If <i>source_file</i> references the same file as <i>dest_file</i>, <i>cp</i> may write a diagnostic message to standard error;
it shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i> and shall go on to any remaining files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>source_file</i> is of type directory, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If neither the <b>-R</b> or <b>-r</b> options were specified, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
nothing more with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>source_file</i> was not specified as an operand and <i>source_file</i> is dot or dot-dot, <i>cp</i> shall do nothing more
with <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>dest_file</i> exists and it is a file type not specified by the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the behavior is implementation-defined.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>dest_file</i> exists and it is not of type directory, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
nothing more with <i>source_file</i> or any files below <i>source_file</i> in the file hierarchy, and go on to any remaining
files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the directory <i>dest_file</i> does not exist, it shall be created with file permission bits set to the same value as those
of <i>source_file</i>, modified by the file creation mask of the user if the <b>-p</b> option was not specified, and then
bitwise-inclusively OR'ed with S_IRWXU. If <i>dest_file</i> cannot be created, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic message to
standard error, do nothing more with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files. It is unspecified if <i>cp</i> attempts
to copy files in the file hierarchy rooted in <i>source_file</i>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The files in the directory <i>source_file</i> shall be copied to the directory <i>dest_file</i>, taking the four steps (1 to 4)
listed here with the files as <i>source_file</i>s.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>dest_file</i> was created, its file permission bits shall be changed (if necessary) to be the same as those of
<i>source_file</i>, modified by the file creation mask of the user if the <b>-p</b> option was not specified.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <i>cp</i> utility shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining files.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>If <i>source_file</i> is of type regular file, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>If <i>dest_file</i> exists, the following steps shall be taken:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>
<p>If the <b>-i</b> option is in effect, the <i>cp</i> utility shall write a prompt to the standard error and read a line from the
standard input. If the response is not affirmative, <i>cp</i> shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i> and go on to any
remaining files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A file descriptor for <i>dest_file</i> shall be obtained by performing actions equivalent to the <a href=

called using <i>dest_file</i> as the <i>path</i> argument, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY and O_TRUNC as the <i>oflag</i>
argument.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the attempt to obtain a file descriptor fails and the <b>-f</b> option is in effect, <i>cp</i> shall attempt to remove the
file by performing actions equivalent to the <a href="../functions/unlink.html"><i>unlink</i>()</a> function defined in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 called using <i>dest_file</i> as the <i>path</i> argument. If this attempt

</li>

<li>
<p>If the attempt to obtain a file descriptor fails, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more
with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The contents of <i>source_file</i> shall be written to the file descriptor. Any write errors shall cause <i>cp</i> to write a
diagnostic message to standard error and continue to step 3e.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The file descriptor shall be closed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <i>cp</i> utility shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i>. If a write error occurred in step 3d, it is unspecified if

<div class="box"><em>The following sections are informative.</em></div>

<h4><a name="tag_04_27_16"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The difference between <b>-R</b> and <b>-r</b> is in the treatment by <i>cp</i> of file types other than regular and directory.
The original <b>-r</b> flag, for historic reasons, does not handle special files any differently from regular files, but always
reads the file and copies its contents. This has obvious problems in the presence of special file types; for example, character
devices, FIFOs, and sockets. The <b>-R</b> option is intended to recreate the file hierarchy and the <b>-r</b> option supports
historical practice. It was anticipated that a future version of this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 would deprecate the
<b>-r</b> option, and for that reason, there has been no attempt to fix its behavior with respect to FIFOs or other file types
where copying the file is clearly wrong. However, some implementations support <b>-r</b> with the same abilities as the <b>-R</b>
defined in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. To accommodate them as well as systems that do not, the differences
between <b>-r</b> and <b>-R</b> are implementation-defined. Implementations may make them identical. The <b>-r</b> option is marked
obsolescent.</p>

<p>The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are explicitly cleared when files are created. This is to prevent users from creating
programs that are set-user-ID or set-group-ID to them when copying files or to make set-user-ID or set-group-ID files accessible to
new groups of users. For example, if a file is set-user-ID and the copy has a different group ID than the source, a new group of
users has execute permission to a set-user-ID program than did previously. In particular, this is a problem for superusers copying
users' trees.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_27_17"></a>EXAMPLES</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_27_18"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <b>-i</b> option exists on BSD systems, giving applications and users a way to avoid accidentally removing files when
copying. Although the 4.3 BSD version does not prompt if the standard input is not a terminal, the standard developers decided that
use of <b>-i</b> is a request for interaction, so when the destination path exists, the utility takes instructions from whatever
responds on standard input.</p>

<p>The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified
because implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those used on historical implementations. Therefore, an
application using the <b>-i</b> option relies on the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on
the behavior specified.</p>

<p>The <b>-p</b> option is historical practice on BSD systems, duplicating the time of last data modification and time of last
access. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 extends it to preserve the user and group IDs, as well as the file
permissions. This requirement has obvious problems in that the directories are almost certainly modified after being copied. This
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that the modification times be preserved. The statement that the order in which
the characteristics are duplicated is unspecified is to permit implementations to provide the maximum amount of security for the
user. Implementations should take into account the obvious security issues involved in setting the owner, group, and mode in the
wrong order or creating files with an owner, group, or mode different from the final value.</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether <i>cp</i> writes diagnostic messages when the user and group IDs cannot be set due to the widespread
practice of users using <b>-p</b> to duplicate some portion of the file characteristics, indifferent to the duplication of others.
Historic implementations only write diagnostic messages on errors other than [EPERM].</p>

<p>The <b>-r</b> option is historical practice on BSD and BSD-derived systems, copying file hierarchies as opposed to single files.
This functionality is used heavily in historical applications, and its loss would significantly decrease consensus. The <b>-R</b>
option was added as a close synonym to the <b>-r</b> option, selected for consistency with all other options in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 that do recursive directory descent.</p>

<p>When a failure occurs during the copying of a file hierarchy, <i>cp</i> is required to attempt to copy files that are on the
same level in the hierarchy or above the file where the failure occurred. It is unspecified if <i>cp</i> shall attempt to copy
files below the file where the failure occurred (which cannot succeed in any case).</p>

<p>Permissions, owners, and groups of created special file types have been deliberately left as implementation-defined. This is to
allow systems to satisfy special requirements (for example, allowing users to create character special devices, but requiring them
to be owned by a certain group). In general, it is strongly suggested that the permissions, owner, and group be the same as if the
user had run the historical <i>mknod</i>, <a href="../utilities/ln.html"><i>ln</i></a>, or other utility to create the file. It is
also probable that additional privileges are required to create block, character, or other implementation-defined special file
types.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <b>-p</b> option explicitly requires that all set-user-ID and set-group-ID permissions be discarded if any of
the owner or group IDs cannot be set. This is to keep users from unintentionally giving away special privilege when copying
programs.</p>

<p>When creating regular files, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use the mode of the source file as modified by the file mode
creation mask. Other choices would have been to use the mode of the source file unmodified by the creation mask or to use the same
mode as would be given to a new file created by the user (plus the execution bits of the source file) and then modify it by the
file mode creation mask. In the absence of any strong reason to change historic practice, it was in large part retained.</p>

<p>When creating directories, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use the mode of the source directory, plus read, write, and search
bits for the owner, as modified by the file mode creation mask. This is done so that <i>cp</i> can copy trees where the user has
read permission, but the owner does not. A side effect is that if the file creation mask denies the owner permissions, <i>cp</i>
fails. Also, once the copy is done, historical versions of <i>cp</i> set the permissions on the created directory to be the same as
the source directory, unmodified by the file creation mask.</p>

<p>This behavior has been modified so that <i>cp</i> is always able to create the contents of the directory, regardless of the file
creation mask. After the copy is done, the permissions are set to be the same as the source directory, as modified by the file
creation mask. This latter change from historical behavior is to prevent users from accidentally creating directories with
permissions beyond those they would normally set and for consistency with the behavior of <i>cp</i> in creating files.</p>

<p>It is not a requirement that <i>cp</i> detect attempts to copy a file to itself; however, implementations are strongly
encouraged to do so. Historical implementations have detected the attempt in most cases.</p>

<p>There are two methods of copying subtrees in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. The other method is described as
part of the <a href="../utilities/pax.html"><i>pax</i></a> utility (see <a href="pax.html"><i>pax</i></a> ). Both methods are
historical practice. The <i>cp</i> utility provides a simpler, more intuitive interface, while <a href=
"../utilities/pax.html"><i>pax</i></a> offers a finer granularity of control. Each provides additional functionality to the other;
in particular, <a href="../utilities/pax.html"><i>pax</i></a> maintains the hard-link structure of the hierarchy, while <i>cp</i>
does not. It is the intention of the standard developers that the results be similar (using appropriate option combinations in both
utilities). The results are not required to be identical; there seemed insufficient gain to applications to balance the difficulty
of implementations having to guarantee that the results would be exactly identical.</p>

<p>The wording allowing <i>cp</i> to copy a directory to implementation-defined file types not specified by the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is provided so that implementations supporting symbolic links are not required to prohibit
copying directories to symbolic links. Other extensions to the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 file
types may need to use this loophole as well.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_04_27_21"></a>CHANGE HISTORY</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>First released in Issue 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_27_22"></a>Issue 6</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <b>-r</b> option is marked obsolescent.</p>

<p>The new options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, and <b>-P</b> are added to align with the IEEE&nbsp;P1003.2b draft standard. These options
affect the processing of symbolic links.</p>

<p>IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.2 #194 is applied, adding a description of the <b>-P</b> option.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std 1003.1-2001/Cor&nbsp;1-2002, item XCU/TC1/D6/18 is applied, correcting an error in the SEE ALSO section.</p>
