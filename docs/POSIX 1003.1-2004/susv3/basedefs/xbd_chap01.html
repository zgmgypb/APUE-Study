<h3><a name="tag_01_01">   1.1 </a>Scope</h3>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 defines a standard operating system interface and environment, including a command interpreter
(or &quot;shell&quot;), and common utility programs to support applications portability at the source code level. It is intended to be used
by both applications developers and system implementors.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 comprises four major components (each in an associated volume):</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, including utility conventions
and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Definitions for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific system services for the C programming language,
function issues, including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Definitions for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation services (a &quot;shell&quot;) and common utility
programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, containing historical information concerning
the contents of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 and why features were included or discarded by the standard developers, is included
in the Rationale (Informative) volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The following areas are outside of the scope of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Graphics interfaces</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Database management system interfaces</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Record I/O considerations</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Object or binary code portability</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>System configuration and resource availability</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance to applications
developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on
those functions and facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.</p>

<p>The facilities provided in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 are drawn from the following base documents:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>IEEE Std 1003.1-1996 (POSIX-1) (incorporating IEEE Stds 1003.1-1990, 1003.1b-1993, 1003.1c-1995, and 1003.1i-1995)</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 uses the Base Specifications as its organizational basis and adds the following additional
functionality to them, drawn from the base documents above:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Normative text from the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-1:1996 standard and the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard not included in the Base
Specifications</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The amendments to the POSIX.1-1990 standard and the ISO&nbsp;POSIX-2:1993 standard listed above, except for parts of

</li>

<li>
<p>Portability Considerations</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Additional rationale and notes</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following features, marked legacy or obsolescent in the base documents, are not carried forward into
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Other features from the base documents marked legacy or obsolescent are carried forward unless

<p>The <i>c89</i> utility (which specified a compiler for the C Language specified by the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1990 standard) has been
replaced by a <a href="../utilities/c99.html"><i>c99</i></a> utility (which specifies a compiler for the C Language specified by
the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard).</p>

<p>From XSH5, text marked OH (Optional Header) has been reviewed on a case-by-case basis and removed where appropriate. The XCU5
text marked OF (Output Format Incompletely Specified) and UN (Possibly Unsupportable Feature) has been reviewed on a case-by-case
basis and removed where appropriate.</p>

<p>For the networking interfaces, the base document is the XNS, Issue 5.2 specification. The following parts of the XNS, Issue 5.2
specification are out of scope and not included in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Part 3 (XTI)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Part 4 (Appendixes)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Since there is much duplication between the XNS, Issue 5.2 specification and IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1g-2000, material only from
the following sections of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1g-2000 has been included:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>General terms related to sockets (Section 2.2.2)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Socket concepts (Sections 5.1 through 5.3, inclusive)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <a href="../functions/pselect.html"><i>pselect</i>()</a> function (Sections 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.3)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <a href="../functions/sockatmark.html"><i>sockatmark</i>()</a> function (Section 5.4.13)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <a href="../basedefs/sys/select.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</i></a> header (Section 6.2)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Emphasis is placed on standardizing existing practice for existing users, with changes and additions limited to correcting
deficiencies in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Issues raised by IEEE or ISO/IEC Interpretations against IEEE Std 1003.1 and IEEE Std 1003.2</p>

<p>A reorganization of the options in order to facilitate profiling, both for smaller profiles such as IEEE Std 1003.13, and larger
profiles such as the Single UNIX Specification</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Alignment with the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard</p>

<h3><a name="tag_01_04">   1.4 </a>Terminology</h3>

<p>For the purposes of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the following terminology definitions apply:</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_04_01"></a>can</h4>

<p>Describes a permissible optional feature or behavior available to the user or application. The feature or behavior is mandatory
for an implementation that conforms to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An application can rely on the existence of the feature or
behavior.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_04_02"></a>implementation-defined</h4>

<p>Describes a value or behavior that is not defined by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 but is selected by an implementor. The value
or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An application should not rely on the
existence of the value or behavior. An application that relies on such a value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across
conforming implementations.</p>

<p>The implementor shall document such a value or behavior so that it can be used correctly by an application.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_04_03"></a>legacy</h4>

<p>Describes a feature or behavior that is being retained for compatibility with older applications, but which has limitations
which make it inappropriate for developing portable applications. New applications should use alternative means of obtaining
equivalent functionality.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_04_04"></a>may</h4>

<p>Describes a feature or behavior that is optional for an implementation that conforms to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An
application should not rely on the existence of the feature or behavior. An application that relies on such a feature or behavior
cannot be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>

<p>To avoid ambiguity, the opposite of <i>may</i> is expressed as <i>need not</i>, instead of <i>may not</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_04_05"></a>shall</h4>

<p>For an implementation that conforms to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, describes a feature or behavior that is mandatory. An
application can rely on the existence of the feature or behavior.</p>

<p>For an application or user, describes a behavior that is mandatory.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_04_06"></a>should</h4>

<p>For an implementation that conforms to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, describes a feature or behavior that is recommended but
not mandatory. An application should not rely on the existence of the feature or behavior. An application that relies on such a
feature or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>

<p>For an application, describes a feature or behavior that is recommended programming practice for optimum portability.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_04_07"></a>undefined</h4>

<p>Describes the nature of a value or behavior not defined by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 which results from use of an invalid
program construct or invalid data input.</p>

<p>The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An application should not
rely on the existence or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any particular value or behavior cannot
be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_04_08"></a>unspecified</h4>

<p>Describes the nature of a value or behavior not specified by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 which results from use of a valid
program construct or valid data input.</p>

<p>The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An application should not
rely on the existence or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any particular value or behavior cannot
be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_01_05">   1.5 </a>Portability</h3>

<p>Some of the utilities in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 and functions in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 describe functionality that might not be fully portable to systems meeting the
requirements for POSIX conformance (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href=
"../basedefs/xbd_chap02.html#tag_02">Chapter 2, Conformance</a>).</p>

<p>Where optional, enhanced, or reduced functionality is specified, the text is shaded and a code in the margin identifies the
nature of the option, extension, or warning (see <a href="#tag_01_05_01">Codes</a>). For maximum portability, an application
should avoid such functionality.</p>

<p>Unless the primary task of a utility is to produce textual material on its standard output, application developers should not
rely on the format or content of any such material that may be produced. Where the primary task <i>is</i> to provide such material,
but the output format is incompletely specified, the description is marked with the OF margin code and shading. Application
developers are warned not to expect that the output of such an interface on one system is any guide to its behavior on another
system.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_02">  1.5.2 </a>Margin Code Notation</h4>

<p>Some of the functionality described in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 depends on support of more than one option, or
independently may depend on several options. The following notation for margin codes is used to denote the following cases.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_05_02_01"></a>A Feature Dependent on One or Two Options</h5>

<p>In this case, margin codes have a &lt;space&gt; separator; for example:</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('MF')">MF</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
This feature requires support for only the Memory Mapped Files option. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border=
"0"></p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('MF SHM')">MF SHM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border=
"0"> This feature requires support for both the Memory Mapped Files and the Shared Memory Objects options; that is, an application
which uses this feature is portable only between implementations that provide both options. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt=
"[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_05_02_02"></a>A Feature Dependent on Either of the Options Denoted</h5>

<p>In this case, margin codes have a <tt>'|'</tt> separator to denote the logical OR; for example:</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('MF')">MF|SHM</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
This feature is dependent on support for either the Memory Mapped Files option or the Shared Memory Objects option; that is, an
application which uses this feature is portable between implementations that provide any (or all) of the options. <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_05_02_03"></a>A Feature Dependent on More than Two Options</h5>

<p>The following shorthand notations are used:</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('MC1')">MC1</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
The MC1 margin code is shorthand for ADV (MF|SHM). Features which are shaded with this margin code require support of the Advisory
Information option and either the Memory Mapped Files or Shared Memory Objects option. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt=
"[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('MC2')">MC2</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
