<h4><a name="tag_03_537_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() function shall destroy the mutex object referenced by <i>mutex</i>; the mutex object becomes,
in effect, uninitialized. An implementation may cause <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() to set the object referenced by <i>mutex</i>
to an invalid value. A destroyed mutex object can be reinitialized using <i>pthread_mutex_init</i>(); the results of otherwise
referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.</p>

<p>It shall be safe to destroy an initialized mutex that is unlocked. Attempting to destroy a locked mutex results in undefined
behavior.</p>

<p>The <i>pthread_mutex_init</i>() function shall initialize the mutex referenced by <i>mutex</i> with attributes specified by
<i>attr</i>. If <i>attr</i> is NULL, the default mutex attributes are used; the effect shall be the same as passing the address of
a default mutex attributes object. Upon successful initialization, the state of the mutex becomes initialized and unlocked.</p>

<p>Only <i>mutex</i> itself may be used for performing synchronization. The result of referring to copies of <i>mutex</i> in calls
to <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_trylock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_trylock</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_unlock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>()</a>, and <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() is undefined.</p>

<p>Attempting to initialize an already initialized mutex results in undefined behavior.</p>

<p>In cases where default mutex attributes are appropriate, the macro PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER can be used to initialize mutexes
that are statically allocated. The effect shall be equivalent to dynamic initialization by a call to <i>pthread_mutex_init</i>()
with parameter <i>attr</i> specified as NULL, except that no error checks are performed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_537_04"></a>RETURN VALUE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>If successful, the <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() and <i>pthread_mutex_init</i>() functions shall return zero; otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.</p>

<p>The [EBUSY] and [EINVAL] error checks, if implemented, act as if they were performed immediately at the beginning of processing
for the function and shall cause an error return prior to modifying the state of the mutex specified by <i>mutex</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_537_05"></a>ERRORS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() function may fail if:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>[EBUSY]</dt>

<h4><a name="tag_03_537_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<h5><a name="tag_03_537_08_01"></a>Alternate Implementations Possible</h5>

<p>This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 supports several alternative implementations of mutexes. An implementation may
store the lock directly in the object of type <b>pthread_mutex_t</b>. Alternatively, an implementation may store the lock in the
heap and merely store a pointer, handle, or unique ID in the mutex object. Either implementation has advantages or may be required
on certain hardware configurations. So that portable code can be written that is invariant to this choice, this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not define assignment or equality for this type, and it uses the term &quot;initialize&quot; to
reinforce the (more restrictive) notion that the lock may actually reside in the mutex object itself.</p>

<p>Note that this precludes an over-specification of the type of the mutex or condition variable and motivates the opaqueness of
the type.</p>

<p>An implementation is permitted, but not required, to have <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() store an illegal value into the mutex.
This may help detect erroneous programs that try to lock (or otherwise reference) a mutex that has already been destroyed.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_03_537_08_02"></a>Tradeoff Between Error Checks and Performance Supported</h5>

<p>Many of the error checks were made optional in order to let implementations trade off performance <i>versus</i> degree of error
checking according to the needs of their specific applications and execution environment. As a general rule, errors or conditions
caused by the system (such as insufficient memory) always need to be reported, but errors due to an erroneously coded application
(such as failing to provide adequate synchronization to prevent a mutex from being deleted while in use) are made optional.</p>

<p>A wide range of implementations is thus made possible. For example, an implementation intended for application debugging may
implement all of the error checks, but an implementation running a single, provably correct application under very tight
performance constraints in an embedded computer might implement minimal checks. An implementation might even be provided in two
versions, similar to the options that compilers provide: a full-checking, but slower version; and a limited-checking, but faster
version. To forbid this optionality would be a disservice to users.</p>

<p>By carefully limiting the use of &quot;undefined behavior&quot; only to things that an erroneous (badly coded) application might do, and
by defining that resource-not-available errors are mandatory, this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 ensures that a
fully-conforming application is portable across the full range of implementations, while not forcing all implementations to add
overhead to check for numerous things that a correct program never does.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_03_537_08_03"></a>Why No Limits are Defined</h5>

<p>Defining symbols for the maximum number of mutexes and condition variables was considered but rejected because the number of
these objects may change dynamically. Furthermore, many implementations place these objects into application memory; thus, there is
no explicit maximum.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_03_537_08_04"></a>Static Initializers for Mutexes and Condition Variables</h5>

<p>Providing for static initialization of statically allocated synchronization objects allows modules with private static
synchronization variables to avoid runtime initialization tests and overhead. Furthermore, it simplifies the coding of
self-initializing modules. Such modules are common in C libraries, where for various reasons the design calls for
self-initialization instead of requiring an explicit module initialization function to be called. An example use of static
initialization follows.</p>

<p>Without static initialization, a self-initializing routine <i>foo</i>() might look as follows:</p>

<pre>
<tt>static pthread_once_t foo_once = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
static pthread_mutex_t foo_mutex;
<br>
void foo_init()
{
    pthread_mutex_init(&amp;foo_mutex, NULL);
}
<br>
void foo()
{
    pthread_once(&amp;foo_once, foo_init);
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mutex);
   /* Do work. */
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mutex);
}
</tt>
</pre>

<p>With static initialization, the same routine could be coded as follows:</p>

<pre>
<tt>static pthread_mutex_t foo_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
<br>
void foo()
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mutex);
   /* Do work. */
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mutex);
}
</tt>
</pre>

<p>Note that the static initialization both eliminates the need for the initialization test inside <a href=
"../functions/pthread_once.html"><i>pthread_once</i>()</a> and the fetch of &amp;<i>foo_mutex</i> to learn the address to be passed
to <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_unlock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, the C code written to initialize static objects is simpler on all systems and is also faster on a large class of systems;
those where the (entire) synchronization object can be stored in application memory.</p>

<p>Yet the locking performance question is likely to be raised for machines that require mutexes to be allocated out of special
memory. Such machines actually have to have mutexes and possibly condition variables contain pointers to the actual hardware locks.
For static initialization to work on such machines, <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a>
also has to test whether or not the pointer to the actual lock has been allocated. If it has not, <a href=
"../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> has to initialize it before use. The reservation of such
resources can be made when the program is loaded, and hence return codes have not been added to mutex locking and condition
variable waiting to indicate failure to complete initialization.</p>

<p>This runtime test in <a href="../functions/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>()</a> would at first seem to be
extra work; an extra test is required to see whether the pointer has been initialized. On most machines this would actually be
implemented as a fetch of the pointer, testing the pointer against zero, and then using the pointer if it has already been
initialized. While the test might seem to add extra work, the extra effort of testing a register is usually negligible since no
extra memory references are actually done. As more and more machines provide caches, the real expenses are memory references, not
instructions executed.</p>

<p>Alternatively, depending on the machine architecture, there are often ways to eliminate <i>all</i> overhead in the most
important case: on the lock operations that occur <i>after</i> the lock has been initialized. This can be done by shifting more
overhead to the less frequent operation: initialization. Since out-of-line mutex allocation also means that an address has to be
dereferenced to find the actual lock, one technique that is widely applicable is to have static initialization store a bogus value
for that address; in particular, an address that causes a machine fault to occur. When such a fault occurs upon the first attempt
to lock such a mutex, validity checks can be done, and then the correct address for the actual lock can be filled in. Subsequent
lock operations incur no extra overhead since they do not &quot;fault&quot;. This is merely one technique that can be used to support
static initialization, while not adversely affecting the performance of lock acquisition. No doubt there are other techniques that
are highly machine-dependent.</p>

<p>The locking overhead for machines doing out-of-line mutex allocation is thus similar for modules being implicitly initialized,
where it is improved for those doing mutex allocation entirely inline. The inline case is thus made much faster, and the
out-of-line case is not significantly worse.</p>

<p>Besides the issue of locking performance for such machines, a concern is raised that it is possible that threads would serialize
contending for initialization locks when attempting to finish initializing statically allocated mutexes. (Such finishing would
typically involve taking an internal lock, allocating a structure, storing a pointer to the structure in the mutex, and releasing
the internal lock.) First, many implementations would reduce such serialization by hashing on the mutex address. Second, such
serialization can only occur a bounded number of times. In particular, it can happen at most as many times as there are statically
allocated synchronization objects. Dynamically allocated objects would still be initialized via <i>pthread_mutex_init</i>() or <a
href="../functions/pthread_cond_init.html"><i>pthread_cond_init</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, if none of the above optimization techniques for out-of-line allocation yields sufficient performance for an
application on some implementation, the application can avoid static initialization altogether by explicitly initializing all
synchronization objects with the corresponding <i>pthread_*_init</i>() functions,
which are supported by all implementations. An implementation can also document the tradeoffs and advise which initialization
technique is more efficient for that particular implementation.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_03_537_08_05"></a>Destroying Mutexes</h5>

<p>A mutex can be destroyed immediately after it is unlocked. For example, consider the following code:</p>

<pre>
<tt>struct obj {
pthread_mutex_t om;
    int refcnt;
    ...
};
<br>
obj_done(struct obj *op)
{
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;op-&gt;om);
    if (--op-&gt;refcnt == 0) {
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;op-&gt;om);
(A)     pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;op-&gt;om);
(B)     free(op);
    } else
(C)     pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;op-&gt;om);
}
</tt>
</pre>

<p>In this case <i>obj</i> is reference counted and <i>obj_done</i>() is called whenever a reference to the object is dropped.
Implementations are required to allow an object to be destroyed and freed and potentially unmapped (for example, lines A and B)
immediately after the object is unlocked (line C).</p>
